### 🧠 About Me

- 🕶️ I see what others ignore  
- 🐚 I feed on the terminal and chaos  
- 🔐 I build tools that whisper in the shadows  
- 🧠 Always learning — from system internals to kernel-level exploits  
- 🎭 My code speaks. My name is silence.

### 🧬 My Code Philosophy

> In a world of noise — I choose silence  
> In a world of flashy interfaces — I choose the terminal  
> In a world of surveillance — I choose the shadows  
> Leave no trace. Repeat no query. Trust no name.  
> Only the code is truth.

### 🔮 Manifesto

If you’re reading this — you're already searching.  
If you're searching — you already know.  
This world isn't made of clicks and screens.  
It's made of bytes you can twist.  
Files you can open.  
Networks you can listen to.  
And in this chaos — you can be the master.
